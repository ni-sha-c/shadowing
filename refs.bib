    abstract = { The spectral rigidity ⊿(L) of a set of quantal energy levels is the mean square deviation of the spectral staircase from the straight line that best fits it over a range of L mean level spacings. In the semiclassical limit (ℏ→0), formulae are obtained giving ⊿(L) as a sum over classical periodic orbits. When L ≪Lmax, where Lmax ~ℏ-(N-1) for a system of N freedoms, ⊿(L) is shown to display the following universal behaviour as a result of properties of very long classical orbits: if the system is classically integrable (all periodic orbits filling tori), ⊿(L)═ 1/5L (as in an uncorrelated (Poisson) eigenvalue sequence); if the system is classically chaotic (all periodic orbits isolated and unstable) and has no symmetry, ⊿(L) ═ In L/2π2+Dif 1≪ L≪ Lmax (as in the gaussian unitary ensemble of random-matrix theory); if the system is chaotic and has time-reversal symmetry, ⊿(L) = In L/π2 + Eif 1 ≪ L ≪ Lmax (as in the gaussian orthogonal ensemble). When L ≫ Lmax, ⊿(L) saturates non-universally at a value, determined by short classical orbits, of order ℏ–(N–1) for integrable systems and In (ℏ-1) for chaotic systems. These results are obtained by using the periodic-orbit expansion for the spectral density, together with classical sum rules for the intensities of long orbits and a semiclassical sum rule restricting the manner in which their contributions interfere. For two examples ⊿(L) is studied in detail: the rectangular billiard (integrable), and the Riemann zeta function (assuming its zeros to be the eigenvalues of an unknown quantum system whose unknown classical limit is chaotic). }

abstract = {Due to the butterfly-effect, computer-generated chaotic simulations often deviate exponentially from the true solution, so that it is very hard to obtain a reliable simulation of chaos in a long-duration time. In this paper, a new strategy of the so-called Clean Numerical Simulation (CNS) in physical space is proposed for spatio-temporal chaos, which is computationally much more efficient than its predecessor (in spectral space). The strategy of the CNS is to reduce both of the truncation and round-off errors to a specified level by implementing high-order algorithms in multiple-precision arithmetic (with sufficient significant digits for all variables and parameters) so as to guarantee that numerical noise is below such a critical level in a temporal interval t∈[0,Tc] that corresponding numerical simulation remains reliable over the whole interval. Without loss of generality, the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) is used to illustrate its validity. As a result, a reliable long-duration numerical simulation of the CGLE is achieved in the whole spatial domain over a long interval of time t∈[0,3000], which is used as a reliable benchmark solution to investigate the influence of numerical noise by comparing it with the corresponding ones given by the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method in double precision (RKwD). Our results demonstrate that the use of double precision in simulations of chaos might lead to huge errors in the prediction of spatio-temporal trajectories and in statistics, not only quantitatively but also qualitatively, particularly in a long interval of time.}

abstract = {Due to the famous butterfly-effect, it is rather difficult to gain a reliable simulation of chaos in an interval of time that is long enough from statistic viewpoint. In this paper we propose an efficient numerical strategy of the clean numerical simulation (CNS) in physical space to gain reliable simulation of spatio-temporal chaos in a long enough interval of time by means of reducing both of truncation and round-off error to a required tiny level. Without loss of generality, the damped driven sine-Gordon equation is used to illustrate its validity for spatio-temporal chaos. The reliable result in a long interval of time given by this CNS algorithm is used as benchmark solution to investigate the influence of numerical noise (i.e. truncation and round-off error) by comparing it in details with those given by the Runge-Kutta’s method in double precision. It is found that numerical noise can lead to, both quantitatively and qualitatively, huge deviation of the spatio-temporal chaotic system not only in trajectories but also even in statistics! Therefore, in practice we should check very carefully the reliability of computer-generated simulations of spatio-temporal chaotic systems (including turbulent flows), especially when the duration of simulation is quite long. The new strategy of the CNS in physical space provides us an efficient way to accurately study lots of spatio-temporal chaotic systems in science and engineering in a long enough interval of time so as to reveal some new physical truths by means of clearing away numerical noises.}

	abstract = {The classical theory of linear response applies to statistical mechanics close to equilibrium. Away from equilibrium, one may describe the microscopic time evolution by a general differentiable dynamical system, identify nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) and study how these vary under perturbations of the dynamics. Remarkably, it turns out that for uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems (those satisfying the ‘chaotic hypothesis’), the linear response away from equilibrium is very similar to the linear response close to equilibrium: the Kramers–Kronig dispersion relations hold, and the fluctuation–dispersion theorem survives in a modified form (which takes into account the oscillations around the ‘attractor’ corresponding to the NESS). If the chaotic hypothesis does not hold, two new phenomena may arise. The first is a violation of linear response in the sense that the NESS does not depend differentiably on parameters (but this nondifferentiability may be hard to see experimentally). The second phenomenon is a violation of the dispersion relations: the susceptibility has singularities in the upper half complex plane. These ‘acausal’ singularities are actually due to ‘energy nonconservation’: for a small periodic perturbation of the system, the amplitude of the linear response is arbitrarily large. This means that the NESS of the dynamical system under study is not ‘inert’ but can give energy to the outside world. An ‘active’ NESS of this sort is very different from an equilibrium state, and it would be interesting to see what happens for active states to the Gallavotti–Cohen fluctuation theorem.}

In NILSS, we represent a tangent solution by a linear combination of one inhomogeneous tangent solution and several homogeneous tangent solutions. Next, we solve a least squares problem using this representation; thus, the resulting solution can be used for computing sensitivities. NILSS is easy to implement with existing solvers. In addition, for chaotic systems with many degrees of freedom but few unstable modes, NILSS has a low computational cost. NILSS is applied to two chaotic PDE systems: the Lorenz 63 system and a CFD simulation of flow over a backward-facing step. In both cases, the sensitivities computed by NILSS reflect the trends in the long-time averaged objectives of dynamical systems."

abstract = "The sensitivity of long-time averages of a hyperbolic chaotic system to parameter perturbations can be determined using the shadowing direction, the uniformly-bounded-in-time solution of the sensitivity equations. Although its existence is formally guaranteed for certain systems, methods to determine it are hardly available. One practical approach is the Least-Squares Shadowing (LSS) algorithm (Wang (2014) [18]), whereby the shadowing direction is approximated by the solution of the sensitivity equations with the least square average norm. Here, we present an alternative, potentially simpler shadowing-based algorithm, termed periodic shadowing. The key idea is to obtain a bounded solution of the sensitivity equations by complementing it with periodic boundary conditions in time. We show that this is not only justifiable when the reference trajectory is itself periodic, but also possible and effective for chaotic trajectories. Our error analysis shows that periodic shadowing has the same convergence rates as LSS when the time span T is increased: the sensitivity error first decays as 1/T and then, asymptotically as 1/T. We demonstrate the approach on the Lorenz equations, and also show that, as T tends to infinity, periodic shadowing sensitivities converge to the same value obtained from long unstable periodic orbits (Lasagna (2018) [14]) for which there is no shadowing error. Finally, finite-difference approximations of the sensitivity are also examined, and we show that subtle non-hyperbolicity features of the Lorenz system introduce a small, yet systematic, bias."

In an iterated process, if errors double each iterate and numerical calculations have 50-bit (or 15-digit) accuracy, a true orbit through a point can be expected to have no correlation with a numerical orbit after 50 iterates. On the other hand, numerical studies often involve hundreds of thousands of iterates. One may therefore question the validity of such studies. A relevant result in this regard is that of Anosov and Bowen who showed that systems which are uniformly hyperbolic will have the shadowing property: a numerical (or noisy) orbit will stay close to (shadow) a true orbit for all time. Unfortunately, chaotic processes typically studied do not have the requisite uniform hyperbolicity, and the Anosov-Bowen result does not apply. We report rigorous results for nonhyperbolic systems: numerical orbits typically can be shadowed by true orbits for long time periods."

The result from these methods can be too large, often by orders of magnitude, when the result is the derivative of a long time averaged quantity. This failure is known to be caused by ill-conditioned initial value problems. This paper overcomes this failure by replacing the initial value problem with the well-conditioned “least squares shadowing (LSS) problem”. The LSS problem is then linearized in our sensitivity analysis algorithm, which computes a derivative that converges to the derivative of the infinitely long time average. We demonstrate our algorithm in several dynamical systems exhibiting both periodic and chaotic oscillations."
