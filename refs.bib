	abstract = {The classical theory of linear response applies to statistical mechanics close to equilibrium. Away from equilibrium, one may describe the microscopic time evolution by a general differentiable dynamical system, identify nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) and study how these vary under perturbations of the dynamics. Remarkably, it turns out that for uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems (those satisfying the ‘chaotic hypothesis’), the linear response away from equilibrium is very similar to the linear response close to equilibrium: the Kramers–Kronig dispersion relations hold, and the fluctuation–dispersion theorem survives in a modified form (which takes into account the oscillations around the ‘attractor’ corresponding to the NESS). If the chaotic hypothesis does not hold, two new phenomena may arise. The first is a violation of linear response in the sense that the NESS does not depend differentiably on parameters (but this nondifferentiability may be hard to see experimentally). The second phenomenon is a violation of the dispersion relations: the susceptibility has singularities in the upper half complex plane. These ‘acausal’ singularities are actually due to ‘energy nonconservation’: for a small periodic perturbation of the system, the amplitude of the linear response is arbitrarily large. This means that the NESS of the dynamical system under study is not ‘inert’ but can give energy to the outside world. An ‘active’ NESS of this sort is very different from an equilibrium state, and it would be interesting to see what happens for active states to the Gallavotti–Cohen fluctuation theorem.}

abstract = "This paper develops the Non-Intrusive Least Squares Shadowing (NILSS) method, which computes the sensitivity for long-time averaged objectives in chaotic dynamical systems. In NILSS, we represent a tangent solution by a linear combination of one inhomogeneous tangent solution and several homogeneous tangent solutions. Next, we solve a least squares problem using this representation; thus, the resulting solution can be used for computing sensitivities. NILSS is easy to implement with existing solvers. In addition, for chaotic systems with many degrees of freedom but few unstable modes, NILSS has a low computational cost. NILSS is applied to two chaotic PDE systems: the Lorenz 63 system and a CFD simulation of flow over a backward-facing step. In both cases, the sensitivities computed by NILSS reflect the trends in the long-time averaged objectives of dynamical systems."

abstract = "The sensitivity of long-time averages of a hyperbolic chaotic system to parameter perturbations can be determined using the shadowing direction, the uniformly-bounded-in-time solution of the sensitivity equations. Although its existence is formally guaranteed for certain systems, methods to determine it are hardly available. One practical approach is the Least-Squares Shadowing (LSS) algorithm (Wang (2014) [18]), whereby the shadowing direction is approximated by the solution of the sensitivity equations with the least square average norm. Here, we present an alternative, potentially simpler shadowing-based algorithm, termed periodic shadowing. The key idea is to obtain a bounded solution of the sensitivity equations by complementing it with periodic boundary conditions in time. We show that this is not only justifiable when the reference trajectory is itself periodic, but also possible and effective for chaotic trajectories. Our error analysis shows that periodic shadowing has the same convergence rates as LSS when the time span T is increased: the sensitivity error first decays as 1/T and then, asymptotically as 1/T. We demonstrate the approach on the Lorenz equations, and also show that, as T tends to infinity, periodic shadowing sensitivities converge to the same value obtained from long unstable periodic orbits (Lasagna (2018) [14]) for which there is no shadowing error. Finally, finite-difference approximations of the sensitivity are also examined, and we show that subtle non-hyperbolicity features of the Lorenz system introduce a small, yet systematic, bias."

However, many of these methods fail when applied to chaotic systems, such as the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (K–S) equation, which models a number of different chaotic systems found in nature. The following paper discusses the application of a new sensitivity analysis method developed by the authors to a modified K–S equation. We find that least squares shadowing sensitivity analysis computes accurate gradients for solutions corresponding to a wide range of system parameters."

abstract = "Chaotic processes have the property that relatively small numerical errors tend to grow exponentially fast. In an iterated process, if errors double each iterate and numerical calculations have 50-bit (or 15-digit) accuracy, a true orbit through a point can be expected to have no correlation with a numerical orbit after 50 iterates. On the other hand, numerical studies often involve hundreds of thousands of iterates. One may therefore question the validity of such studies. A relevant result in this regard is that of Anosov and Bowen who showed that systems which are uniformly hyperbolic will have the shadowing property: a numerical (or noisy) orbit will stay close to (shadow) a true orbit for all time. Unfortunately, chaotic processes typically studied do not have the requisite uniform hyperbolicity, and the Anosov-Bowen result does not apply. We report rigorous results for nonhyperbolic systems: numerical orbits typically can be shadowed by true orbits for long time periods."

The result from these methods can be too large, often by orders of magnitude, when the result is the derivative of a long time averaged quantity. This failure is known to be caused by ill-conditioned initial value problems. This paper overcomes this failure by replacing the initial value problem with the well-conditioned “least squares shadowing (LSS) problem”. The LSS problem is then linearized in our sensitivity analysis algorithm, which computes a derivative that converges to the derivative of the infinitely long time average. We demonstrate our algorithm in several dynamical systems exhibiting both periodic and chaotic oscillations."
